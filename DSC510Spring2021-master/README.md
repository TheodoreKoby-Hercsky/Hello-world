"#DSC510Spring2021" 
For this week you will Clone a copy of these repo.  You can do that using a variety of ways.  
- You can use GitHub from the command line "I prefer this approach".
- You can use GitHub Desktop (this is very popular).
- You can use Sourcetree
- You can configure GitHub to work through Pycharm.  (I recommend against this for starters).

Your assignment should be a folder named "LAST_NAME_DSC510".  In this folder you will have a single file called Hello_World.py or something similiar.  This will be a simple hello world program.  See my example for more information
